1. Always use the existing beenchilling.js and main.css
2. Always use jQuery for Javascript, instead of Vanilla Javascript
3. Always check the database schema when generating code related to database operations.
4. Reuse the _head.php, _foot.php and index.php in the root directory.
5. Reuse functions when applicable and remove the redundant functions.
6. Don't use MVC model
7. Don't use class, access modifier (public, private and protected) for the program.

• Use HTML5 and CSS3 for the frontend.
• Use jQuery instead of plain JavaScript whenever possible.
• The project must be built by using PHP 8.2.12 or above.
• The database must be implemented by using MySQL.
• The database programming must be implemented by using PDO.

The followings are NOT allowed:
• Ready-made HTML and CSS layout templates.
• PHP frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Yii and CodeIgniter).
• CSS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, Tailwind and Foundation).
• JavaScript frameworks (e.g. React, Angular and Vue).
[NOTE] Small external PHP, JavaScript and jQuery libraries are ALLOWED to ease your project
development (and it is sometimes unavoidable). However, better marks will be awarded if you
code it yourself whenever possible.

The web programming conventions used in the course must be strictly followed:
• Reuse the base PHP and JavaScript libraries created in the practical in your project.
• Modify or extend the base PHP and JavaScript libraries if necessary.
• Create your own reusable library functions if you are doing something repeatedly.
• Use HTML helpers to generate input controls, error messages, etc.
• Create your own reusable HTML helpers if necessary.
• Avoid inline JavaScript for event-handling. Use jQuery event-handling instead.
• If you refer to external references, adapt the codes to match our conventions.
• You can reuse the layouts created in the practical and enhance further.
• You can reuse the demos created in the practical and enhance further.
• Follow other programming styles as what we adhere in the practical.
[NOTE] This is NOT meant to stop you from being creative. Instead, this is to prevent you from
copying codes blindly from external references. You can refer to external references, but
please understand how the codes work, then modify and adapt the codes to match our
conventions. Codes that cannot be explained and do not follow conventions will be penalized.
